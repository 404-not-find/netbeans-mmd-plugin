    <h1>Scia Reto editor</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Project</h2>
    <p>The first step is either select or create a project. Because initially the editor was developed for software projects, "project" means just a folder. You can create new project through <b>File-&gt;New project</b> or choose existing folder through <b>File-&gt;Open project</b>. Opened project will be remembered and it will be opened automatically during next start of the application. Opened project will be shown in the project tree panel. You can close opened project in any moment, "close" means just removing project from panel without any deletion of the folder on disk.</p>
    <h2>Files</h2>
    <p>Main work item in the editor is a file, a file can be created in a project folder through pop-up menu, just activate pop-up menu for a project folder and select needed file format in <b>New...</b>. If you want open a file then just click twice on needed file in project tree. If you want open the file in associated system browser then activate pop-up menu for the file and select <b>Open in System</b>. File can be also removed through <b>Delete</b> and in the case the file will be removed from disk.</p>
    <h2>Mind maps</h2>
    <p>Mind map file (with *.mmd extension) will be opened in graphical view and by default it has only one root topic node. If you want add new nodes then:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Select mind node with mouse click</li>
      <li>Activate pop-up</li>
      <li>Click <b>Add child</b></li>
      <li>Also you can add new node by <b>TAB</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>Pop-up menu is the main way for manipulations with a mind map but also there are some keyboard shortcuts, the main keyboard shortcuts are <b>TAB</b>(to add new child node) and <b>ENTER</b>(to add sibling node), you can navigate between nodes with cursor keys.</p>
